# VBA-Challenge

## Background
My client asked me to create a way to analyze thousands of stocks from multiple years using Microsoft Excel and VBA in order to determine the best investment options. 

## Overview of Project
The first macro I created analyzed the Total Daily Volume and Return for twelve potential stocks.

While this macro did what was needed, it was a bit slow.

My client was interested in making the process more efficient so he could use it for future analyses.
